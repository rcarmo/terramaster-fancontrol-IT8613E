# Fan control for TerraMaster on Linux

Tested with F4-424 Max under Proxmox VE 9. This is a fork of [@Nikotine1's conversion to the F4-424 Pro](Nikotine1/terramaster-fancontrol-IT8613E), which was in turn a direct port of the [Xpenology fancontrol script by Eudean](https://xpenology.com/forum/topic/14007-terramaster-f4-220-fan-control/?ct=1559481439) to work on OMV/Debian and tested on the Pro model.

I intend to make a few changes to this as time progresses.

## Original README follows:

This fork implements changes for it to work with NAS devices containing the IT8613E chipset, while the original program only supported IT8772E (used in the F4-220).
Initially I made the changes described in [this post](https://xpenology.com/forum/topic/14007-terramaster-f4-220-fan-control/?do=findComment&comment=264172), but in the end I just commented out the part that was specific for the IT8772E.

Further improvements are:
1. It no longer uses the creation of files in ``/opt/disks``, named after the disks you want to monitor.
Instead, you give it a list of drive names as an argument.
2. I have also added reporting to a Graphite server.
Enable it by adding ``--graphite_server=<ip address>:<port>``.
This allows you to monitor the fan speed in Grafana:

3. New PID controller for the fan speed.

## Installation:
Warning: As from Truenas 24.10.1, [the home folder is no longer executable](https://forums.truenas.com/t/shell-script-permission-denied-with-24-10-1/27941). Instead, use the data pool for your scripts.

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nikotine1/terramaster-fancontrol-IT8613E
   ```

2. Build with GCC.
   - Pull the image:
     ```
     docker pull gcc
     ```
   - Compile fancontrol.cpp:
     ```
     sudo docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp gcc gcc -o fancontrol fancontrol.cpp
     ```

3. Run the compiled program.
   ```
   sudo ./fancontrol --drive_list="sda,sdb,sdc,sdd" --debug=1 --setpoint=37
   ```
   This will run it in debug mode (1), monitoring drives /dev/sda to d, with temperature setpoint 37°C. Make sure to run with sudo.

4. Alternatively, you can use the included systemd service.
   - Change the location of the fancontrol application.
   - Make sure you also add the list of drives there.
   - Copy it to `/etc/systemd/system`:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start fancontrol.service
     sudo systemctl enable fancontrol.service
     ```
   - You will have to reinstall the service after every Truenas update. I use a shell script to do this(install_service.sh).

## Parameters:
```
 fancontrol --drive_list=<drive_list> [--debug=<value>] [--setpoint=<value>] [--pwminit=<value>] [--interval=<value>] [--overheat=<value>] [--pwmmin=<value>] [--kp=<value>] [--ki=<value>] [--imax=<value>] [--kd=<value>] [--cpu_avg=<value>] [--graphite_server=<ip:port>]

drive_list        A comma-separated list of drive names between quotes e.g. 'sda,sdc' (required)
debug             Enable (1) or disable (0) debug logs (default: 0)
setpoint          Target maximum hard drive operating temperature in
                  degrees Celsius (default: 37)
pwminit           Initial PWM value to write (default: 128)
interval          How often we poll for temperatures in seconds (default: 10)

                  which we drive the fans at maximum speed (default: 45)
pwmmin            Never drive the fans below this PWM value (default: 80)
kp                Proportional coefficient (default: 50.0)
ki                Integral coefficient (default: 0.5)

kd                Derivative coefficient (default: 0.0)
cpu_avg           Number of CPU temperature measurements for rolling average (default: 10)
graphite_server   Graphite server IP address and port in the format <ip:port> (optional)
```
